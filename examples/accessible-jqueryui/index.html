		<p>This page contains some interactive controls that you would normally only find in desktop applications.
		Examples of such controls are tab lists, menu bars, sliders, and tree views. These controls are often operated using the arrow keys, which means your screen
		reader must temporarily switch off virtual navigation mode in order to interact with them. Some screen readers will automatically switch between modes depending on the control's type,
		while others require you to manually turn virtual mode off. The list below shows how to switch between modes on some popular screen readers:
		</p>
		 <dl>
		 	<dt>JAWS</dt>
		 	<dd>JAWS KEY + Z, use twice to make switch permanent</dd>

				<h3>
					Dogs
				</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						The dog (Canis lupus familiaris, is a domesticated
						form of the wolf, a member of the Canidae family of
						the order Carnivora. The term is used for both
						feral and pet varieties. The domestic dog has been
						one of the most widely kept working and companion
						animals in human history. The word "dog" may also
						mean the male of a canine species, as opposed to
						the word "bitch" for the female of the species.
					</p>
					<p>
						The dog quickly became ubiquitous across culture
						across the world, and was extremely valuable to
						early human settlements. For instance, it is
						believed that the successful emigration across the
						Bering Strait might not have been possible without
						sled dogs. Dogs perform many roles for people, such
						as hunting, herding, protection, assisting police
						and military, companionship, and, more recently,
						aiding handicapped individuals. This versatility,
						more than almost any other known animal, has given
						them the nickname "Man's best friend" in the
						western world. Currently, there are estimated to be
						400 million dogs in the world.
					</p>
					<p>
						Over the 15,000 year span that the dog had been
						domesticated, it diverged into only a handful of
						landraces, groups of similar animals whose
						morphology and behavior have been shaped by
						environmental factors and functional roles. As the
						modern understanding of genetics developed, humans
						began to intentionally breed dogs for a wide range
						of specific traits. Through this process, the dog
						has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and
						shows more behavioral and morphological variation
						than any other land mammal. For example, height
						measured to the withers ranges from a few inches in
						the Chihuahua to a few feet in the Irish Wolfhound;
						color varies from white through grays (usually
						called "blue'") to black, and browns from light
						(tan) to dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a wide
						variation of patterns; coats can be short or long,
						coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or
						smooth. It is common for most breeds to shed this
						coat.
					</p>

				</div>
				<h2>
					Cats
				</h2>
				<div>
					<p>
						The cat (Felis catus), also known as the domestic
						cat or housecat to distinguish it from other
						felines and felids, is a small domesticated
						carnivorous mammal that is valued by humans for its
						companionship and its ability to hunt vermin and
						household pests. Cats have been associated with
						humans for at least 9,500 years, and are currently
						the most popular pet in the world. Due to their
						close association with humans, cats are now found
						almost everywhere on Earth. This extreme
						adaptability and their worrying impacts on native
						animals has led to them being classed as an
						invasive species. Most of these problems are caused
						by the large number of feral cats worldwide, with a
						population of up to 60 million of these animals in
						the United States alone.
					</p>
					<p>
						Cats are similar in size and anatomy to the other
						Felids, with light, flexible bodies and teeth
						adapted to killing small prey. A skilled predator,
						the cat hunts over 1,000 species for food, using
						its excellent eyesight and hearing. Unusually, cats
						have lost the ability to taste sugar and in some
						breeds show hereditary deafness. Despite being
						solitary hunters, cats are a social species and use
						a variety of vocalizations, pheromones and types of
						body language for communication. These include
						meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and
						grunting. They are also bred and shown as
						registered pedigree pets. This hobby is known as
						cat fancy.
					</p>
					<p>
						As The New York Times wrote in 2007, "Until
						recently the cat was commonly believed to have been
						domesticated in ancient Egypt, where it was a cult
						animal." A study that year found that the lines of
						descent of all house cats probably run through as
						few as five self-domesticating African Wildcats
						(Felis silvestris lybica) circa 8000 BC, in the
						Near East. The earliest direct evidence of cat
						domestication is a kitten that was buried with its
						owner 9,500 years ago in Cyprus.

				<h3>
					Sheep
				</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						Domestic sheep are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals
						typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants,
						sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the
						even-toed ungulates. Although the name "sheep"
						applies to many species, in everyday usage it
						almost always refers to Ovis aries. Numbering a
						little over 1 billion, domestic sheep are the most
						numerous species in their genus.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sheep are most likely descended from the wild
						mouflon of Europe and Asia. One of the earliest
						animals to be domesticated for agricultural
						purposes, sheep are raised for fleece, meat (lamb,
						hogget or mutton) and milk. A sheep's wool is the
						most widely used of any animal, and is usually
						harvested by shearing. Ovine meat is called lamb
						when from younger animals and mutton when from
						older ones. Sheep continue to be important for wool
						and meat today, and are also occasionally raised
						for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms
						for science.

				<h3>
					Fish
				</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						A fish is any member of a paraphyletic group of
						organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic
						craniate animals that lack limbs with digits.
						Included in this definition are the living hagfish,
						lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish, as well
						as various extinct related groups. Most fish are
						ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body
						temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures
						change, though some of the large active swimmers
						like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core
						temperature. Fish are abundant in most bodies
						of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic
						environments, from high mountain streams (e.g.,
						char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal
						depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and
						anglerfish). At 32,000 species, fish exhibit
						greater species diversity than any other group of
						vertebrates.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fish are an important resource worldwide,
						especially as food. Commercial and subsistence
						fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries (see fishing)
						or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see
						aquaculture). They are also caught by recreational
						fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, and
						exhibited in public aquaria. Fish have had a role
						in culture through the ages, serving as deities,
						religious symbols, and as the subjects of art,
						books and movies.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because the term "fish" is defined negatively, and
						excludes the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians,
						reptiles, birds and mammals) which descend from
						within the same ancestry, it is paraphyletic, and
						is not considered a proper grouping in systematic
						biology. The traditional term pisces (also
						ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a
						phylogenetic classification.
					</p>
					<p>
						The earliest organisms that can be classified as
						fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared
						during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked a
						true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed
						them to be more agile than their invertebrate
						counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through
						the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety
						of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed
						external armor that protected them from predators.
						The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian
						period, after which many (such as sharks) became
						formidable marine predators rather than just the
						prey of arthropods.

					Lizards
				</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						Lizards are a widespread group of squamate
						reptiles, with more than 5600 species , ranging
						across all continents except Antarctica as well as
						most oceanic island chains. The group,
						traditionally recognized as the suborder
						Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the
						Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales),
						which are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor
						snakes &#226;&#8364;&#8220; they form an
						evolutionary grade. While the snakes are
						recognized as falling phylogenetically within the
						Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the
						Sphenodonts are the sister group to the Squamates,
						the larger monophyletic group, which includes both
						the lizards and the snakes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Lizards typically have feet and external ears,
						while snakes lack both of these characteristics.
						However, because they are defined negatively as
						excluding snakes, lizards have no unique
						distinguishing characteristic as a group. Lizards
						and snakes share a movable quadrate bone,
						distinguishing them from the sphenodonts, which
						have a more primitive and solid diapsid skull. Many
						lizards can detach their tails to escape from
						predators, an act called autotomy, but this ability
						is not shared by all lizards. Vision, including
						color vision, is particularly well developed in
						most lizards, and most communicate with body
						language or bright colors on their bodies as well
						as with pheromones.
					</p>
					<p>
						The adult length of species within the suborder
						ranges from a few cm for chameleons like Brookesia
						micra and geckos like Sphaerodactylus ariasae to
						nearly 3 m (9.8 ft) in the case of the largest
						living varanid lizard, the Komodo Dragon. Some
						extinct varanids reached great size. The extinct
						aquatic mosasaurs reached 17 m (56 ft), and the
						giant monitor Megalania prisca is estimated to have
						reached perhaps 7 m (23 ft).

				<h2>Dogs</h2>
				<p>The dog (Canis lupus familiaris, is a domesticated form of the wolf, a member of the Canidae family of the order Carnivora. The term is used for both feral and pet varieties. The domestic dog has been one of the most widely kept working and companion animals in human history. The word "dog" may also mean the male of a canine species, as opposed to the word "bitch" for the female of the species.
				</p><p>
				The dog quickly became ubiquitous across culture across the world, and was extremely valuable to early human settlements. For instance, it is believed that the successful emigration across the Bering Strait might not have been possible without sled dogs. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This versatility, more than almost any other known animal, has given them the nickname "Man's best friend" in the western world. Currently, there are estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world.
				</p><p>
				Over the 15,000 year span that the dog had been domesticated, it diverged into only a handful of landraces, groups of similar animals whose morphology and behavior have been shaped by environmental factors and functional roles. As the modern understanding of genetics developed, humans began to intentionally breed dogs for a wide range of specific traits. Through this process, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal. For example, height measured to the withers ranges from a few inches in the Chihuahua to a few feet in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called "blue'") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth. It is common for most breeds to shed this coat.

			   <h2>Cats</h2>
				<p>
					The cat (Felis catus), also known as the domestic cat or housecat to distinguish it from other felines and felids, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal that is valued by humans for its companionship and its ability to hunt vermin and household pests. Cats have been associated with humans for at least 9,500 years, and are currently the most popular pet in the world. Due to their close association with humans, cats are now found almost everywhere on Earth. This extreme adaptability and their worrying impacts on native animals has led to them being classed as an invasive species. Most of these problems are caused by the large number of feral cats worldwide, with a population of up to 60 million of these animals in the United States alone.
				</p><p>
					Cats are similar in size and anatomy to the other Felids, with light, flexible bodies and teeth adapted to killing small prey. A skilled predator, the cat hunts over 1,000 species for food, using its excellent eyesight and hearing. Unusually, cats have lost the ability to taste sugar and in some breeds show hereditary deafness. Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species and use a variety of vocalizations, pheromones and types of body language for communication. These include meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting. They are also bred and shown as registered pedigree pets. This hobby is known as cat fancy.
				</p><p>
					As The New York Times wrote in 2007, "Until recently the cat was commonly believed to have been domesticated in ancient Egypt, where it was a cult animal." A study that year found that the lines of descent of all house cats probably run through as few as five self-domesticating African Wildcats (Felis silvestris lybica) circa 8000 BC, in the Near East. The earliest direct evidence of cat domestication is a kitten that was buried with its owner 9,500 years ago in Cyprus.

					<h2>Sheep</h2>
					<p>
					Domestic sheep are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name "sheep" applies to many species, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries. Numbering a little over 1 billion, domestic sheep are the most numerous species in their genus.
					</p><p>
					Sheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia. One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleece, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk. A sheep's wool is the most widely used of any animal, and is usually harvested by shearing. Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones. Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science.

	<!--
	Reason for separating templates: Refreshing the entire datepicker during interaction confuses screen readers, specfically because
	the grid heading is marked up as a live region and will often not update if it's destroyed and recreated instead of just having its
	text change. Additionally, interacting with the prev and next links would cause loss of focus issues because the links being interacted
	with will disappear while focused. With this approach there are 3 templates: the outer template (#ui-datepicker-tmpl), The grid template
	(#ui-datepicker-grid-tmpl) and the title template (#ui-datepicker-title-tmpl). This gets rid of the accessibility problems mentioned, and
	also allows developers to modify parts of the datepicker without having to duplicate the entire template.
